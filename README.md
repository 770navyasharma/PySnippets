## Getting Started

To get started with **PySnippets**, youâ€™ll need to install Git and have Python installed on your machine. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for cloning the repository.
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for running the snippets and tests.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Open your terminal and run the following commands:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UTSAVS26/PySnippets.git
   cd PySnippets
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** *(optional but recommended)*:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   If any dependencies are required for a snippet or its tests, install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Exploring Snippets

- Once you have cloned the repository, navigate through the folders to explore the snippets.
- Each folder is organized by category (e.g., `strings`, `math`, `files`), and inside each folder, you will find Python files containing individual snippets.
- For example, to explore string manipulation snippets:
  ```bash
  cd snippets/strings
  ```

- You can then open any `.py` file to view the snippet and its accompanying documentation.
